"""The download loop: monitor → completions → new candidates → sleep/nudge (§5).

APPLICATION layer. A SINGLE task, serial, on the sole download EC connection (spec §3/§5):
no frame interleaving. ``run_download_cycle`` runs ONE iteration (testable without a
shutdown event); ``download_loop`` repeats it then waits ``poll_interval`` OR the nudge
(``DecisionSignal``), until a shutdown event — wired by ``CrawlerApp`` in D-verify.

Flow of one iteration (spec §5, DECISION D8):
  1. MONITOR: ``download_queue()`` → for each entry KNOWN to ``downloads``, reconciles
     ``downloading`` (QUEUED→DOWNLOADING); an unknown entry (download outside the crawler) is
     ignored. Completion is NO LONGER inferred from bytes (see ``_monitor``).
  2. COMPLETIONS: ``shared_files()`` → each tracked hash present in amuled's SHARED files
     (POSITIVE completion signal, with the real on-disk name) → ``set_state(completed)`` →
     ``quarantine.promote(staging_dir / name)`` → ``enqueue_verification`` → ``quarantined``.
     Idempotent: ``promote`` fails → stays ``completed``, does NOT enqueue, retry next round
     (the hash stays in the shared files); already ``quarantined``/``failed`` → skipped.
  3. CANDIDATES: ``catalog.download_decisions()`` (latest=download) ∖ ``downloads`` → for
     each, ``download_policy`` (target status, dedup, cap) → if ``download``:
     ``build_ed2k_link`` (from ``last_observation``) → ``add_link`` → ``record_queued``.
     The cap is recomputed IN MEMORY as the cycle proceeds (``committed += size``).

Errors (Plan C contracts, spec §9): ``MuleUnreachableError`` (EC stream dead) → tolerate, skip
the iteration (the client reconnects next round; amuled persists the downloads).
``RepositoryError`` → absorbed (log + continue). ``promote`` fails → stays ``completed``.
NEVER abandon a stalled download. Determinism: ``Clock``/``sleep`` injected.
