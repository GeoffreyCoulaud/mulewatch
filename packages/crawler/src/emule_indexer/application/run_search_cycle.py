"""One search cycle: status → coverage → keywords → fan-out → drain → advance (§4).

APPLICATION layer. ``run_search_cycle`` runs ONE cycle (spec §4):

  1. ``network_status`` of EACH worker → aggregated ``effective_coverage`` (logged).
  2. ``generate_keywords(config_keywords)`` → sentinels; ``shuffle_for_cycle`` (seed =
     node_id + cycle index).
  3. enqueue a ``SearchTask`` (keyword × channel) into a shared ``asyncio.Queue``.
  4. N workers drain in parallel (one per instance); one sentinel per worker.
  5. queue drained → ``write_cycle_state`` (index = N+1, last_full_cycle_at) AND
     ``save_channel_backoff`` (snapshot of the SHARED registry) — AT THE SAME TIME (spec §3/§7).

The pool degenerates to a sequential loop at N=1 (spec §3). The workers share the
queue; each reads until the ``None`` sentinel. The ``TaskGroup`` supervises: a
cancellation (shutdown, spec §6) lands at the next network ``await``, never mid DB
write (sync repos). The backoff (shared registry, mutated by the workers during
the cycle) is PERSISTED only at the END of the cycle, exactly like ``cycle_index``: a kill
mid-way replays the cycle AND re-arms the backoff from the previous cycle's state (consistent —
the index does not advance mid-cycle either, spec §7).

NEVER RAISES (aligned with ``run_download_cycle``/``run_verification_cycle``): a
``RepositoryError`` on the end-of-cycle writes (``write_cycle_state``/``save_channel_backoff``)
is ABSORBED → log + return without advancing the index; the cycle will be replayed. Without this
net, the exception propagates out of the supervising ``TaskGroup`` which cancels ALL sibling
loops (download/verify/port-sync) → app crash on a transient persistence failure.
